# Upload B2

Web client to directly upload to B2, where we store all the videos.  
Eventually our server will pull the video from there when it needs it.

We copy a fork from https://github.com/Klowner/uppy/tree/backblaze-b2 for uppy b2 integration.  
We can remove that and use master if this is eventually merged https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1933

## Server
Unfortunately we also need to host the companion for this to work.
